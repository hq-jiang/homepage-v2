It describes the mapping between two images that observe the same plane. It might be intimidating to interpret the effects of a matrix with 9 parameters and 8 degrees of freedom at first. But we can decompose the matrix into separate parts, each with less DoF and easier to understand. </p> </a> <a href="/blog_entries/01_photogrammetry.html" class="card card-none-deco"> <h1>First Experiments with Photogrammetry</h1> <p> Recently, I have been thinking a lot about SfM methods (Structure from Motion) and how to apply them into a self-driving car setting. While my research was more focused on deep learning based methods, I became more curious about classical methods, since they require a great deal of maths and geometry. Eventually, I wanted to start a project wherein I reconstruct my own room and somehow put it one my homepage. The viewer would then somehow be able to walk inside my room. At least, this was how I fantasized the end result. </p> </a> <a href="/blog_entries/02_list_of_papers.html" class="card card-none-deco"> <h1>List of Notable Papers</h1> <p> A list of papers in the fields of computer vision, machine learning and general research. </p> </a> <a href="/blog_entries/03_find_command.html" class="card card-none-deco"> <h1>The Bash <code class="language-bash">find</code> Command</h1> <p> A cheat sheet for the most common usages. </p> </a> </div> <footer class="footer-grid-area"><a href="https://www.freepik.com/vectors/pattern">Rose Pattern background image thanks to freepik - www.freepik.com</a></footer> </div> <script src="/prism.dcb99570.js"></script> </body></html>
